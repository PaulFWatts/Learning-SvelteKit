  - Auto Rename Tag (HTML productivity)

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PaulFWatts/Learning-SvelteKit.git
   cd Learning-SvelteKit
   ```

2. **Navigate to current project**
   ```bash
   cd todo_app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in VS Code**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

## 🎓 Learning Methodology

### Python Developer Transition Approach
- **Concept Mapping**: Web concepts explained through Python equivalents
- **Progressive Complexity**: Building from simple to advanced projects
- **Practical Focus**: Learning through building real applications
- **Documentation**: Detailed README files for each project phase

### Key Concept Mappings
| Web Concept | Python Equivalent | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Components | Classes/Modules | Reusable code organization |
| Props | Function Parameters | Data passing between components |
| Stores | Global Variables/Singletons | Application state management |
| Actions | Route Handlers | Server-side request processing |
| Reactive Statements | @property Decorators | Automatic value updates |
